MODISL1DB 1.6 released December 10, 2009

Notable changes in this release are:

-Updated to Collection 6 l1bgen_modisa and l1bgen_modist programs:

  http://www.mcst.ssai.biz/mcstweb/L1B/Collection_6_Info.html

-There is now only one Linux distribution of MODISL1DB. This release has
 been tested on various versions of CentOS, Fedora, and Ubuntu using both
 Intel and AMD processors, and will likely run on most other Linuxes.
 If you encounter problems please let us know.

-Added support for Intel Mac OS X 10.6.
-Dropped support for Intel and PowerPC Mac OS X 10.4.
-Dropped support for Solaris 8 (SunOS 5.8)

-MODIS scripts can now be executed concurrently in the same directory
 allowing for processing multiple files at once in one directory.

-Added the l1asubset_modis binary that strips non-ocean bands out of
 Level-1A files for oceans processing. This greatly reduces filesize and
 speeds up processing.

NOTE: If you have already installed a previous version of MODISL1DB,
simply install MODISL1DB 1.6 in a new directory and point your DBHOME
environment variable to this new directory. If you already have the
digital elevation maps, there is no need to re-download them. You can
simply move them into the $DBHOME/data/modis/static/ directory or create
a symbolic link that points to them.

MODISL1DB 1.5 released March 31, 2008

*IMPORTANT*: This release contains no processing code changes, but
many of the Unix binaries have been renamed for standardization
purposes (and to stay in sync with SeaDAS). This will NOT affect most
users, since the wrapper processing scripts have not been renamed and
these scripts are all that is needed to carry out the processing. See
below for more details.

**************
Currently supported platforms:

 - Ubuntu Linux 7.10 (kernel 2.6.22)
 - RedHat Linux Fedora Core 6 (kernel 2.6.20)
 - RedHat Linux Fedora Core 4 (kernel 2.6.11)
 - CentOS Linux 4.4 (kernel 2.6.9)
 - Intel Macintosh OS X 10.4/10.5
 - PowerPC Macintosh OS X 10.4/10.5
 - Solaris 8 (SunOS 5.8) on a Sun Blade 100 Workstation (64-bit binaries only)


Changes:

**************
-All processing binaries are now statically linked for the Linux
 distributions. This may allow users to run MODISL1DB on a wider
 variety of unsupported Linux systems.

**************
-Added support for Ubuntu 7.10 Linux
-Added support for Intel Mac OS X 10.5 (OS X 10.4 is still supported)
-Added support for PowerPC Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.4
-Dropped support for PowerPC Mac OS X 10.3
-Dropped support for RedHat Linux Fedora Core 2
-Dropped support for RedHat Linux 7.3

**************
-New directory location for attitude and ephemeris files. These files
 are now stored and accessed in $DBHOME/var/modis/atteph/ (instead of
 in $DBHOME/data/modis/atteph/).

**************
-Many Unix binaries have been renamed. This will NOT affect most users,
 since the wrapper processing scripts have not been renamed and these
 scripts are all that is needed to carry out the processing. However,
 if you happen to make direct use of any of the binaries contained in
 the MODISL1DB bin directory, please check the following table to see

MODISL1DB 1.4.1 released September 25, 2007

The only change for version 1.4.1 is an updated terra_l1bgen binary.
This update fixes a problem in the MOD_PRO2 (terra_l1bgen) processing
code that was causing MODIS-Terra L1A to L1B processing to fail
depending on which calibration LUT versions were being used. The issue
was determined (by MODAPS and the OBPG) to involve the RVS correction
limits set in the PreprocessP.h file. The threshold values have been
relaxed in the PreprocessP.h header file from:

#define RVS_CORRECTION_UPPER_LIMIT  1.2e+0
#define RVS_CORRECTION_LOWER_LIMIT  8.0e-1

to:

#define RVS_CORRECTION_UPPER_LIMIT  2.4e+0
#define RVS_CORRECTION_LOWER_LIMIT  4.0e-1

This change appears to fix the problem. The new terra_l1bgen binary
should now work with any past and future calibration LUTs.

========================================================================

MODISL1DB 1.4 released July 23, 2007

**************
Level 0 to Level 1A processing changes:

-new modis_l1agen binary (MOD_PR01 V5.0.3): code updated to be in  sync
 with the MODIS Science Data Support Team

-updated Aqua/Terra geolocation maneuver, geolocation parameter, and
 ENG_DATA_LIST files to V5.0.27

-fix_L0 binary: fixed a small counting error

-date2jd binary: fixed bug on certain linux systems that would result
 in the error "set: Variable name must begin with a letter"

-updated modis_L0_to_L1A_GEO.csh script:

  -added the "-n next_granule_filename" option for specifying the next
   concurrent L0 granule. This enables geolocation of the last scanline
   of the input L0 file. Setting this option forces the stopnudge
   parameter to be set to 0.

  -added the "-b" option to activate use  of the base of the input
   filename up to first "." for output filenames. This is so filename
   bases can now be kept identical through the processing chain instead
   of the seconds potentially changing...
   e.g.: A2007111165000.L1A_LAC -> A2007111165001.GEO

  -fixed some "rm" statements to use "rm -f" for users who's environment
   has a "rm -i" alias set.


**************
Geolocation processing:

-new geolocate binary (MOD_PR03 V5.0.6): code updated to be in  sync
 with the MODIS Science Data Support Team

-updated Aqua/Terra geolocation maneuver, geolocation parameter, and
 ENG_DATA_LIST files to V5.0.27

-Extraction metadata from the L1A file (if present) is now copied to the
 geolocation file, e.g.:
       Extract_Pixel_Offset = 396
       Extract_Pixel_Count = 226
       Extract_Line_Offset = 258
       Extract_Line_Count = 36

 This can be accessed by the user and is also detected by the SeaDAS
 msl12 and msscanpixlimits binaries.

-updated modis_L1A_to_GEO.csh script:

  -added the "-b" option to activate use  of the base of the input
   filename up to first "." for output filenames. This is so filename
   bases can now be kept identical through the processing chain instead
   of the seconds potentially changing...
   e.g.: A2007111165000.L1A_LAC -> A2007111165001.GEO

-updated modis_definitive_atteph.csh script:

  -the definitive attitude files have been changed from AM1ATTNF.A* to
   AM1ATTN0.A*. This is spacecraft attitude that has been refined by the
   Level 0 processing facility. AM1ATTNF.A* files are the FDD (Flight
   Dynamics Division) predicted data from flight dynamics. According to
   MODAPS, they are used only for spacecraft-manuever periods, where
   typically the ATTN0 files will be absent or not work.


**************
Level 1A to Level 1B processing:

-modis_L1A_to_L1B.csh:

  -added the "-b" option to activate use  of the base of the input
   filename up to first "." for output filenames. This is so filename
   bases can now be kept identical through the processing chain instead
   of the seconds potentially changing...
   e.g.: A2007111165000.L1A_LAC -> A2007111165001.L1B


**************
-improved modisl1db_benchmarks.bash benchmark script to report both
 CPU time and wall clock time

**************
-fixed bug in modis_update_luts.csh script so it no longer fails when
 no calibration LUTs whatsoever exist on a user's hard disk

MODISL1DB 1.3 released for Intel-based Macs, February 6, 2007

Added new support for the Intel-based Mac OS X platform.


========================================================================
========================================================================

MODISL1DB 1.3 released August 1, 2006

Changes:

**************
-Minor bug fixes to most of the processing scripts.

**************
-Added use of the curl ftp client (if curl is detected on the host) to
 the geolocation processing scripts to allow for listing multiple
 directories with one connection. Also tweaked ftp parameters for all
 scripts that use ftp. These changes may help to prevent reaching the
 OBPG firewall connection limits.

**************
-Fixed a bug with the write_constructor_file binary that was causing it
 to hang when the L0 file had an incomplete scan line.

**************
-Added the write_5min_gran binary. This utility will split Level 0
 granules into separate chunks of length specified by the user.
 Executing the command on the UNIX command line prints usage statement:

  USAGE: write_5min_gran MODIS_L0_PDS_file [granule_length] [zulu_start_time]

  granule_length: Time in seconds of each generated granule. (default = 300 sec)

  zulu_start_time: Time of the first packet included in the granule(s). All packets
                   before this time will be ignored. All packets after this time
                   will be included in the output L0 granule(s). If zulu_start_time
                   is not set, the first output granule's filename will be set to the
                   rounded 5 minute interval preceding the time of the first packet.
                   zulu_start_time example: 2006-06-12T16:50:00.00000
                   (default = start time of first packet in L0 granule)


...So the command can be run with:

 -only the MODIS_L0_PDS_file argument
 -with the MODIS_L0_PDS_file and granule_length arguments
 -with all three args in the order specified

The output filename format for each of the chunked granules is
ifile_YYYYDDDHHMM. For example if your input file is "t1.04146.1453.pds",
and you run write_5min_gran without specifying granule_length or
zulu_start_time, then the output filenames will be:

  t1.04146.1453.pds_20041461450
  t1.04146.1453.pds_20041461455

**************
-Added the fix_L0 binary. This utility will create a new L0 file with L0
 packets of the wrong length removed. Executing the command on the UNIX
 command line prints usage statement:

  USAGE:    fix_L0 MODIS_L0_PDS_file -1 -1
         OR
            fix_L0 MODIS_L0_PDS_file taitime_start taitime_stop output_L0_file

  NOTE: Using the '-1 -1' arguments will write information to stdout, including
        valid taitime_start and taitime_stop times for re-input into fix_L0.


**************
-Added the fix_L0 functionality directly into the Level 0 processing
 script modis_L0_to_L1A_GEO.csh. Now if a problem is encountered with
 the L0 file, fix_L0 will be run in an attempt to repair the file, and
 processing will continue. This feature can be disabled by using the new
 modis_L0_to_L1A_GEO.csh "-disable-fix_L0" option:

  -disable-fix_L0 (optional)
  Disable automatic use of the fix_L0 utility if a corrupt or wrong-sized
  Level 0 packet is detected by the write_constructor_file binary, while
  attempting to generate the constructor file. If this option is used and
  such an error is detected, processing will stop. Otherwise, an attempt
  will be made to create a new Level 0 file with the problem packet(s)
  removed, and if successful processing will proceed.

**************
-Improved MODl1extract to handle high res. (HKM and QKM) file extraction.

**************
-To fix a security hazard, the attitude/ephemeris retrieval mechanism
 has been changed and the processing scripts no longer create world
 writeable directories under $DBHOME/data/modis/atteph/. This change
 does NOT affect users who have write permission for the
 $DBHOME/data/modis/atteph/ directory. Users without write permissions
 under $DBHOME/data/modis/atteph/ must now set up their own directory
 and define the MODIS_ATTEPH variable. In this case, the processing
 scripts will check both the user-defined directory as well as
 $DBHOME/data/modis/atteph/ for required atteph files.

**************
-Added the modisl1db_benchmarks.bash script which will process a user-
 specified Level 0 PDS file to L1A/GEO and then to L1B, calculating the
 time required for the processing. A benchmark table will eventually be
 hosted on the MODISL1DB website listing benchmarks from various
 platforms for processing the OBPG demo Aqua L0 file,
 MOD00.P2006214.0540_1.PDS. If you perform any benchmarks on this file,
 please email the results to seadas@seadas.gsfc.nasa.gov.

========================================================================

MODISL1DB 1.2 released December 13, 2005

The major change in this update is the addition of a new MODIS L1A
extraction script.  Given two latitude/longitude corners of a geographic
box, the new modis_L1A_extract.csh script will extract data within the
box, creating a subscened L1A file and an optional corresponding GEO
file. The new L1A/GEO subscene can then be processed to an L1B file in
the usual way. Unlike the L1A file, the resulting subscened L1B file
will be padded to contain the full original swath width, with pixels
falling outside the extraction box being set to arbitrary meaningless
values depending on the band.

The new L1A and L1B files will contain in their HDF headers the
following non-standard fields:

   Extract Pixel Offset
   Extract Pixel Count
   Extract Line Offset
   Extract Line Count

L1B subscene files can then be processed to Level 2 Ocean data using the
SeaDAS msl12 program. msl12 will detect the original subscene box and
only process data contained within this box. If your Level 2 processor
is not msl12, it may be able to process the L1B padded subscence as is,
or may require modification. (Also note that the SeaDAS software package
is capable of displaying and navigating L1A, L1B, L2, and L3 subscenes.)


AFFECTED FILES:

bin/aqua_l1bgen, bin/terra_l1bgen:
  -fixed bug in the LOCALGRANULEID field so now only the filename and
   not the path is written

bin/MODl1extract:
  -new binary utility, called by the new L1A extractor script to perform
   the actual extraction

bin/MODll2snpx:

   lat/lons to scan/pixel numbers

doc/README.modis_L1A_extract:
  -readme document for the new L1A extractor script

scripts/modis_L0_to_L1A_GEO.csh, scripts/modis_L1A_to_GEO.csh:
  -fixed bug for certain platforms that can't handle long command lines
  -fixed bug where in some situations the *.met files were not being
   removed after processing

scripts/modis_L1A_extract.csh:
  -new MODIS L1A subscene extraction script. The script is a wrapper for
   the new MODll2snpx and MODl1extract binaries. Given lat/lon corners
   of a geographic box, the script will extract data within the box and
   optionally create a new corresponding GEO file.

scripts/modis_L1A_to_L1B.csh:
  -added command line option to keep/delete the 1km/hkm/qkm L1B files
  -fixed bug for certain platforms that can't handle long command lines
  -fixed bug where in some situations the *.met files were not being
   removed after processing

scripts/modis_update_luts.csh:
